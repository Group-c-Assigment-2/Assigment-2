# Assigment-2

There are three types of spaceships: a cargo vessel, a starship, and a warbird. Each of these carries a payload and a propulsion system. The warbird and starship also carry a weapons system. The mass of each spaceship has to be determined in order to calculate the energy required to accelerate a spaceship to a certain velocity, according to the equation for kinetic energy: E=0.5mv2. Knowing the energy required to accelerate a spaceship to a certain velocity, the amount of matter/anti-matter annihilation required to generate such energy (assuming 100% efficiency) can be calculated from E=mc2, m=E/c2. Furthermore, since these spaceships are traveling through space, they have the ability to generate their own matter/anti-matter from the level of light around them.
